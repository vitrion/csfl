# CUDA-Streams Fuzzy Logic
The CUDA-Streams Fuzzy Logic (CSFL) is the easiest way to design Non-Singleton Type-1 Fuzzy Logic Systems, which has the ability of computing large amounts of inputs and rules concurrently, by using one of the most interesting properties of CUDA: the Streams.

The project structure is based on the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. The CSFL tool has been designed as an Object-Oriented C++11 implementation with CUDA 8.0. However it can also be imported in a NVIDIA Nsight Eclipse project. Also, it has been tested in the following GPUs: GTX650 Ti and Tesla K40C.
